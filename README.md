# ClimatMonitorOn_arduinoNano_Reley_BMP280_ESP826
This is a second part of IoT project. Here you will find a solution for monitoring temperature and preasure by arduino nano nad bmp280 sensor. This data will be displayed on nokia 5110  display and used for turning on/off reley. Also it will use ESP8266 01 module to connect over internet to IBM cloud and receive data from movable sensor which is described on https://github.com/MykolaPod/ESP8266_DHT22_OTA repo
